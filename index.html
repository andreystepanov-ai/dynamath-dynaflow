      <h1>Dyna Flow Visualisation</h1>
      <p>
        This demo illustrates the core idea behind the dynamic mathematics
        formalism: concepts, relations and processes flow continuously and
        interact through a field. The animation below simulates a fluid
        flow field; each particle represents a concept moving through the
        semantic landscape. The patterns that emerge symbolise the
        structures described by the equations in the paper.

      <p>
        Fundamental dynamic equations used in the paper (for example, the
        Maxwell-like field equations) establish that changes in one field
        induce changes in another. Here, the velocity field
        \(\mathbf{v}(x,y)\) is defined by a set of simple sine and cosine
        functions, and particles follow this field, drawing out trajectories
        reminiscent of the dynamic flows of ideas.
